                <h4>Speaker Submissions</h4>

                <p>Without you, this conference will be pretty boring. So bring us your software talks, bring us your
                    hardware talks, bring us your process and team talks, bring us your talks about feelings. We'd love
                    to read all about them! Submissions are open right now and will close on March 28th. You'll hear
                    back from us by April 4th. We can't wait to see what you've got, so click the button!</p>

                <h4>What's this all about?</h4>

                <p>The next step after 1DevDay Detroit. We love DevDays, and with half the organizing team helping with
                    self.conference, we wanted to create something just as affordable and accessible with twice as much
                    amazing content. We're packing two days with mobile, web, hardware, software, process, and team
                    talks to provide you the best opportunity to grow, mentor and learn as yourself, a part of the
                    community, and a part of Detroit's exploding economy.</p>

                <h4>Angela Harms</h4>
                <p>Angela Harms is an agile developer, coach, facilitator, and instigator. She loves beautiful code that emerges from collaboration, and learning new ways to make it work. When she’s not pairing on tests and the code they inspire, you can find her at conferences speaking about what she’s learned (so far), facilitating kick-ass retrospectives, or discussing the intersection of software and love in open space.</p>

                <h4>Careful with those People Skills: You'll poke somebody's eye out!</h4>

                <p>"People skills" are offered up as a way to get along with people better, to get them to do what you want, and to generally make your life easier. But often, a simple technique can backfire and produce the opposite response. How do you know you're doing it right? Why do people get mad when you give your feedback exactly like the book says to do it?</p>

                <p>Lao Tzu said "The world is won by those who let it go." Giving up the steps and practices -- focusing instead on the underlying ideas and values -- can guide you to better relationships and better collaboration. Dig deep and learn how empathetic listening, authentic connection, and embodying compassion can fit naturally into your life and your work.</p>
