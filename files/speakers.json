The answer lies not within the practices, but within the principles set forth in the Agile Manifesto. In this session, Nayan will guide you through the 12 Agile Principles and describe how to use them to revolutionize your work or neglect them and be content with getting \"slightly better\".",

We’ll stick to iOS (hey, the session is only 50 minutes long) and look at the fundamentals of how OpenGL works, how we can use Apple’s GLKit framework to streamline development, and how awesome the OpenGL debugging tools in Xcode are (really). When we’re done you’ll have seen how to draw a basic 3D scene on iOS, and at the very least know if you want to pursue learning more or run away screaming.",

So one could ask, “What is it that makes one team happier and more productive than the other?”<br />While company culture plays a role in aligning the broader organization, one can find vast differences from one team to the next. How can these differences between teams in the same organization be explained? <br />The differences are in the intangibles, the “Squishy Stuff”, like the spirit of collaboration and teamwork, supported by an underlining feeling of trust.  When trust is present a safety net for fearless expression is created. <br />Strong teams are made of members who trust and consistently seek feedback from their peers; this interaction supports the personal growth for all because feedback consists of encouragement to reinforce positive behaviors and honest conversation about where there is opportunity.<br />While collaboration and teamwork are important, the essential component driving any team’s success is unified vision and mission; “What is our purpose?”  Purpose is the signpost to keep the team on track.  And with defined purpose, you get “Squishy Stuff”: agile teams that are more meaningful and productive.<br />In this session we will review a case study showing the value of the “Squishy Stuff” through a comparison of two organizations with similar processes and very different results, and what happened when the teams were combined.",

Context info is a way to add a little extra data to any object. Easy observation takes the pain and redundancy out of adding and removing observers and notifications. Waiter can turn unit tests into system tests. Map/reduce/filter are basic array operations which are missing or broken in NSArray. As time allows, I will also demonstrate event bus: adding type safety to NSNotification or custom segues for more complex transitions.",

Everyone nods when someone notes \"people are the hard part\", yet so-called \"soft skills\" often get little more than lip service.

No matter what kind of applications you write, these techniques are essential to writing maintainable, resilient pieces of code. However, it's also quite common that many developers don't know what these concepts are, yet want to learn about them with clear, concise language. If you're a developer that wants to understand these ideas but haven't had the time to focus on them, this presentation is for you. We'll cover topics like dependency injection, mocking, and testing, just to name a few. At the end of this session, you'll have a foundational understanding of these ideas that you can use right away in your current (and hopefully future!) projects.",

This type of engineering and tight control over biologicals has enormous and awesome potential for design of therapeutic systems, curing complex diseases and creating useful consumer products. Imagine a toothpaste that is full of predatory bacteria that will prevent cavities from forming, flashlights that glow without electricity or mats of cells that can transport electrical current as they grow.
